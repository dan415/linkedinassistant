<h2> LLM Components </h2>

This section contains the documentation for the LLM module. The LLM module is composed of two components:

- The langchain agent, which is the main component, in charge of actually using ChatGPT in order to generate the content.
- The ColBERT agent, which is in charge of the information retrieval part of the LLM module.

In following updates, the structure of the LLM module will be generalized in order to add more
information retrieval methods, and more conversational agents.
