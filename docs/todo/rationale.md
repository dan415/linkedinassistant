<h2> Next steps </h2>

I would like to implement the following features:

- [ ] Implement Youtube as a source of information, adding support with Whisper.
- [ ] Implement a way to add new sources of information from Telegram. For example: send it pdfs that can be then added to the manual pdf input folder.
- [ ] Add a parent class for ColBERT called RAG, and implement other methods of information Retrieval.
- [ ] Same with the langchain agent for other Huggingface models and Replicate.
- [ ] Integrate with Dall-E to generate images to accompany the post
- [ ] Add support to program posts in advance.
- [ ] Dockerize the project.
- [ ] Explain how to install and use the project as a service in Linux
- [ ] Expand to other Social Media platforms.


All of these are ideas that I have in mind, but I am open to suggestions and contributions. 
However, I am busy, so I cannot guarantee that I will implement them in the near future. If you want to contribute,
or have any ideas, please do not hesitate to contact me.
