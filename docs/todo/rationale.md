<h2> Next steps </h2>

I would like to implement the following features:

- Expand to other Social Media platforms. (Twitter, Instagram...)
- Next release I will be adding docker support.
- GUI for easy configuration so that users do not have to manually set up environment variables and can change most used settings on the fly.
- Meta filterer/selector algorithm to filter and order the posts based on the user's preferences. Might implement it as an agent or RL 
- Implement calling telegram bot commands as natural language through the agent
- Implement GitHub repositories as a source

These are ideas that I have in mind, but I am open to suggestions and contributions. 
However, I am busy, so I cannot guarantee that I will implement them in the near future. If you want to contribute,
or have any ideas, please do not hesitate to contact me.
